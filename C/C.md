Problem C

*Maple Bacon Pickup Team*

To achieve world domination, the Maple Bacon Pickup Team wants to collect a
huge amount of maple bacon because they believe it will become the main energy
source in the future. However, according to their researchers, the maple bacon
can only be used as an energy source if the Calories it contains is a prime
number.

Theyâ€™ve recently picked up `N` pieces of maple bacon! Given the number of
Calories `C` for each piece, can you tell how many of them can be used as
energy sources?
