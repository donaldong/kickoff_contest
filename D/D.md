Problem D

*Mary's Brilliant Personal Trainer*

Mary's Brilliant Personal Trainer made a perfect plan for her! Each set of
exercise worth some points. No two sets of exercise have the same points.

For example:
- Pull up: 10 pt
- Leg Press: 3 pt
- Push Up: 5 pt 

The objective is to collect as many points as possible, but the points for the
exercise do not count unless Mary has done it at least `K` times. Given a list
of `N` points Mary earned today, how many points does she actually get?

*Input*
The first line contains two integers `N` and `K`, `1 <= K <= N <= 100000`. In
the next one or more lines, there are `N` more integers `P`, representing the
points Mary earned, `1 <= P <= 10000`.

*Constrains*
Time Limit: `1 sec`
Mem Limit: `512 MB`

*Sample Input*
```
5 2
1 2 2 3 6
```

*Sample Output*
```
4
```
